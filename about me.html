<h1> About me </h1>
<p> Hi! I'm Nina, a 25 year old student and photography enthusiast based in Helsinki. I started getting interested in photography around age 12, when I got my first camera phone. After that I've loved taking pictures - whether it was with my cellphone, a polaroid camera or a professional camera. I love experimenting with different styles & working with new people.
