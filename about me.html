    <h2 class="h2"> about me </h2>
    <p class="p1"> Hi I'm Nina! I'm a 25 year old student and photography enthusiast based in Helsinki. I've always been quite a visual person so it's no wonder that when I got my first camera at age 12 - taking photos instantly became my passion.</p>

    <p class="p2"> My signature style is quite distinctive as I mostly shoot portraits and fashion photography, but I do also love experimenting with other styles too.
